# fpe-bloomberg

## 1st Iteration
* WPF component that sends free form commands to Terminal Connect API
* Has a box for Command, Security, and Panel
* Since the Terminal API expects a Panel number (1-4, can be identified by Bloomberg window), this raises the first workflow question: **What terminal (panel) should receive context?**
